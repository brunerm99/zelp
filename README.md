# Zelp - Zellij git hELPer
> The successor to [gelp](https://github.com/brunerm99/small-scripts/blob/main/gelp.nu)

## What is it?
It's a simple alternative to [tmux-sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer) for [Zellij](zellij.dev) written purely in [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/).
It has one basic feature and is not completely done.

## TODO
- [ ] Does not work (as expected) if already in zellij instance. Need the '--background' flag PR to be merged or find a workaround.
- [ ] Add option for automatically activating venvs, if available. This is done manually in each custom layout file, currently.
